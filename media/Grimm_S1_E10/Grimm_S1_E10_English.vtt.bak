1
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,891
Kevin. Steven. Do not give up.

2
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,370
Come on, Steven. You've got to run.

3
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:29,930
I can't. You have to.

4
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,669
Leave me.

5
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,109
Just go.

6
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:48,748
Steven!

7
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,122
You sure you don't want a latte?

8
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,591
Yeah, black's good. All right.

9
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,317
If you say so.

10
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,497
You look sort of uncomfortable.

11
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,727
This isn't something you actually
want to talk about, is it?

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,497
Well, my aunt, before she died

13
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,402
told me I should break
up with Juliette.

14
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,935
Shouldn't we be talking about this
over a couple of beers at midnight?

15
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,708
I want to tell her Tell her what?

16
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,279
What I can... You know,
how I can see.

17
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,845
Blutbads and Siegbarstes
and Hexenbiests.

18
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,478
Okay, okay, okay. I see where
you're going with this.

19
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,489
Now I definitely
could use that beer.

20
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,483
Look, it's gotten too
dangerous for Juliette.

21
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,887
She has no idea what
I'm dealing with.

22
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,661
And that other night,
when I got attacked in my house...

23
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,493
She could have been killed.

24
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,530
Have you not considered how
you're going to do this?

25
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,594
Well, I was hoping you
could give me some advice.

26
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,038
I mean, haven't you ever had to
explain who you are to anyone?

27
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,744
You mean, like,
a normal person? No.

28
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,642
There's no good outcome to that.

29
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,943
Either they believe you
and think they're crazy

30
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,543
or, far more likely, they don't believe
you and they think you're crazy.

31
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,610
Either way, it puts a
strain on a relationship.

32
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,782
Well, I have to tell her something.

33
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,390
You know, I can't
jeopardize her like this.

34
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,823
Maybe that's why your aunt
told you what you have to do.

35
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,158
Look, isn't there a
way that you could...

36
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,697
You know, Blutbad for her?

37
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,670
Okay. Just hold it.

38
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,498
Given the right circumstances,
you know...

39
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,235
Like, in the heat of the
moment kind of thing...

40
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,675
We can be seen if
we want to be seen.

41
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,611
Which, by the way, accounts for
a great many of your legends.

42
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,106
We would have gotten away
with a lot more bad behavior

43
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,412
if it wasn't for guys like
you Grimms who can see us

44
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,713
when we don't want to be seen.

45
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,880
Okay. So, I could
bring her over here,

46
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,150
and you could, you know,
just a little bit.

47
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,988
No, no, no, no, no.

48
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,891
The vast majority of humans just can't
process that kind of information.

49
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,361
They can believe in
all kinds of stuff.

50
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,798
You know, gods, for example.

51
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:48,031
Angels and demons and dinosaurs
and the Big Bang Theory

52
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,801
and E equals MC squared, man.

53
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,899
But that's only because it's
not right in front of them.

54
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,044
They're not looking directly into the
boiling core of the raw universe.

55
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,447
So, you know, confronted
with that kind of reality...

56
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,081
A lot of brains just turn to mush.

57
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,378
So, what am I supposed to do?

58
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,251
Like I'm one to give advice.
Come on.

59
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,854
Even a normal
relationship baffles me.

60
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,124
Yeah.

61
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,269
Hey. White male, late teens.

62
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,264
Looks like something
pecked out his eyes.

63
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,966
Any ID?

64
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,376
Nothing on him except for this.
This was in his pocket.

65
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,072
Puka shell necklace.

66
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,549
I haven't seen one of those since I
was in Waikiki on my first honeymoon.

67
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,314
This kid looks like he went
about 50 rounds with Mike Tyson.

68
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,222
Yeah. Fall from the rocks
didn't do him any favors.

69
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,952
The bruising looks post-mortem.

70
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,459
He probably died before he fell.

71
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,058
White fluid in his nostrils and
around the edge of his mouth

72
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,256
would suggest drowning.

73
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,532
Well, he looks pretty pale,
even for death.

74
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,664
Yeah, it could be the cold water.

75
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,097
Yeah, or this.

76
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,731
Oh.

77
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,008
Anybody believe in vampires?

78
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,309
Ha, ha.

79
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,831
I can't tell you exactly what his

80
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,565
hemoglobin or hematocrit
count was before he died.

81
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,005
But by my estimate,
this kid was cruising at about

82
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,303
a fourth of a tank of blood.

83
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,942
So, how many pints down is that?

84
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,304
Oh, seven plus.

85
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,675
Well, could he have
been a hemophiliac?

86
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,612
I tested for that. Nope.

87
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,308
And no drugs in his system, either.

88
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,851
What about the wounds on his neck?

89
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:41,908
Well...

90
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,517
Well... It could be vampires,
or someone who wants to be a vampire.

91
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,592
Or somebody who wants to
get a lot of blood fast.

92
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,623
These are about the
size of an IV needle.

93
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,391
My hope, it's an IV.

94
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,090
Okay. So, how does a kid get stuck
in the neck with an IV needle

95
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,998
and end up in a river
going over a waterfall?

96
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,234
I saw a lot of this sort
of stuff in the late 80's.

97
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,566
When the Satanic cults
were all the rage.

98
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,802
But not lately.

99
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,604
Maybe they're making a comeback.

100
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,544
So, what killed him? Oh,
he drowned.

101
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,676
But my guess is he drowned because he
was incredibly weak from loss of blood.

102
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,515
So, was it an accident
or a homicide?

103
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,121
Nobody puts IV needles in
their neck by accident.

104
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,820
We've got a hit on the prints.

105
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,562
His name was Steven Bamford.

106
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,329
Eighteen. And he had
a record already.

107
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,894
Shoplifting,
drug possession, B and E.

108
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,671
Last known address,
Portland P.O. box. Zip is downtown.

109
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,943
Check this out. We found the body
here at the base of the falls.

110
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,477
The river above covers miles of
territory with limited land access.

111
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,414
There's no way to tell where
he went into the river.

112
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,782
Okay. We start at the P.O.
box, see if anybody knows him there.

113
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,787
Yeah. Print a few
pictures to take with us.

114
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,160
He rented a box for
about six months.

115
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,456
How often did he pick up his mail?

116
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,796
Every couple of weeks. But I haven't
seen him in at least a month.

117
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,062
He ever come in with anybody?

118
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,626
I never paid attention.

119
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,933
A lot of these street
kids rent boxes from us.

120
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:12,041
But as long as they pay their bills,
I don't ask any questions.

121
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,509
Thanks. Sure.

122
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,444
Hey, Nick, wait a minute.

123
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,815
Hey, that necklace
you're wearing...

124
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,550
Puka shell, right? Yeah. Why?

125
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,113
You ever seen this kid
around here? You cops?

126
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,625
Don't worry. He hasn't
done anything wrong.

127
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,126
If you've seen him, it's important.

128
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,491
I've seen him around,
but I don't know.

129
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,621
Where did you get the necklace?

130
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,891
I traded for it.

131
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,655
With who?

132
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,934
Look. He's dead.

133
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,902
We're just trying to figure
out what happened to him.

134
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,638
She sells them across from the square.
Her name's Gracie.

135
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,353
Nice necklaces. How much?

136
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,518
I'm not selling them.
They're donation only.

137
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,356
You can give me whatever you
want and take whatever you want.

138
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,656
Okay. So you know we're police.

139
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,924
Look, we're not looking for a
business license or anything here.

140
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,489
We just need a little help.
ls your name Gracie?

141
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,304
Uh, this is Steven Bamford.

142
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,701
You recognize him?

143
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,512
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but we found Steven's body.

144
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,712
Steven's dead?

145
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,046
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.

146
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,891
Are you sure? We're sure. Sorry.

147
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,051
What are you doing?

148
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,753
Slow down. We're just
asking some questions.

149
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,421
Why? Who are you?

150
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,026
Look, she didn't do anything,
all right?

151
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,293
That's not the question I asked.

152
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,794
He's my brother.

153
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,425
Steven's dead.

154
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,438
They just told me. What?

155
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,906
How did he die? He drowned.

156
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,813
Have any idea how he got into
the river above Triple Falls?

157
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,238
No.

158
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,712
Last thing we knew, he got a job.

159
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,211
What kind of job?

160
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,187
He was doing, like, ranch work.

161
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,018
They were picking
him up or something.

162
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,182
When was that?

163
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,693
Four, five weeks ago.

164
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,792
Do you know where they picked
him up or who picked him up?

165
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:12,986
No.

166
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,527
When was the last time you saw him?

167
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,131
After we took him to the clinic.

168
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,601
Free clinic on 15th?

169
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,266
Yeah.

170
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,702
Was he involved in
any groups or gangs?

171
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,773
No. Not him.

172
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,740
Being around more than three
people made him uncomfortable.

173
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:32,942
Well, thank you.

174
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,783
Hey, you know what?

175
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,161
My girlfriend is
going to love this.

176
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,666
Softie.

177
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,510
Hi.

178
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,591
Who gets to talk to the police?

179
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,683
That would be our office
manager, Tom Daniels.

180
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:16,920
Let me see if he's available.

181
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,932
Tom? Two police officers
here to talk to you.

182
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,994
Uh-huh. Okay.

183
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,932
He's thrilled. Through the door.
I'll buzz you in.

184
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,471
Mmm. Sorry. You've got to eat
when you can around here.

185
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,034
I'm the office manager,
Tom Daniels.

186
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,872
Hey. Oh. Sorry. Again.

187
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,074
What's up?

188
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,581
I'm Detective Griffin.
This is Detective Burkhardt.

189
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,509
We'd like to ask you
a couple of questions

190
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,849
about a patient you treated here.

191
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,011
Absolutely.

192
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,886
His name was, uh, Steven Bamford.

193
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,626
Mmm. He looks familiar.

194
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,787
If he's on the streets, I'm sure
he was treated here at some point.

195
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,057
I can check the records.

196
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,924
Yeah.

197
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,765
Looks like we treated
him about five weeks ago

198
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,431
on the 17th for a spider bite.

199
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,638
What did he do? He got killed.

200
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,671
Oh. That's, um, not good.

201
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,309
I'm sorry. Uh,
can I ask what happened?

202
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,180
We're still in the middle
of the investigation.

203
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,514
Who treated him when he came in?

204
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,712
Uh... That would be Dr. Levine.

205
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,018
She's the head of the clinic.

206
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,217
Well, we'd like to talk to her.

207
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,485
Well, she's seeing a patient right now.
This won't take long.

208
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,586
We need to establish
his medical condition

209
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,096
when he came in for his treatment.

210
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,599
No, sure, I understand.
I'll print off the file for her.

211
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,869
Just come back tomorrow
for the results. Mmm.

212
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,269
In the meantime, I am going
to give you some prednisone.

213
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,534
But you need to take it
every day, okay? Okay.

214
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,407
Feel better. Thanks.

215
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,270
Sorry to bother you, Dr. Levine.

216
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,712
These detectives have some questions
about a patient you treated.

217
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,147
I'm going to go finish my lunch.

218
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,307
How can I help?

219
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,182
We found Steven Bamford's body.

220
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,586
Oh, what a shame.
Please don't tell me he OD'd.

221
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,387
No, he drowned, actually.

222
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,129
Anything you can tell us about him?
Medical conditions he might have had?

223
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,862
Well, I don't get to spend much
quality time with my patients.

224
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,500
Looks like I treated
him for a spider bite.

225
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,932
It says here I did a cursory exam.

226
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,031
He seemed to be pretty healthy for
someone who was living on the streets.

227
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,800
I gave him some antibiotics and told
him to check back. He never did.

228
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,778
Did he say anything about
being offered a job?

229
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:17,837
Not to me.

230
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,213
I'm really sorry.
I wish I could tell you more.

231
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,580
Dr. Levine.

232
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,484
I have a lot of patients
Thank you for your time.

233
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,754
Who offers a street kid a job,
picks him up, and takes him away?

234
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,160
Sounds like migrant labor.

235
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,289
Cash under the table.

236
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,991
Going to be hard to track.

237
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,498
Burkhardt

238
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,062
Motor vehicle accident?
Why do you need us?

239
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,150
Looks like a human heart to me.

240
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,049
That one looks like a liver.

241
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,317
And a lot of blood.

242
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,087
This is not a medical vehicle.

243
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,390
Then, what's it doing transporting
human organs and blood?

244
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,590
Easy. Easy.

245
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,428
Okay. Trauma team, he's yours.

246
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,682
We're not going to
get much out of him.

247
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,910
But we need his phone.

248
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,625
Dead driver's name
is Andrew Probasco.

249
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,661
Born 1932.

250
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,420
And get this. Died in 2005.

251
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,093
So, he died again today.
Apparently.

252
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,329
Fake license? Looks like.

253
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,562
Ironically, he was an organ donor.

254
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,832
Oh.

255
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,168
What about, uh, plates?

256
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,108
Yeah, stolen. Registered to
a Smart car in Tillamook.

257
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,541
Well, I have got expired
lottery tickets.

258
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,176
A "get one free" pizza at Gianni's.

259
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,311
If only he ate six more.

260
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,911
And a credit card in the
name of Hallie Calder.

261
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,785
He didn't look like a Hallie to me.

262
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,986
What about fingerprints? Oh,
funny you should ask.

263
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,022
Got a match on his prints to half
a dozen crimes all over the state,

264
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,190
but no ID.

265
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,131
He was an unknown.
Never been caught.

266
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,230
So, we got nothing.

267
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,900
Are we depressed?

268
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,867
Were you able to get any info
off the driver's cell phone?

269
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,442
Yes. And no.

270
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,637
Can you just give us the yes? No.

271
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,742
Obviously a burner.

272
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,076
But we were still able to
pull the SEN off the SIM card.

273
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,641
Of course, the service
provider will need a warrant

274
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,518
before they release the records.
And that would be up to you.

275
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,286
And that's all you've got?

276
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,690
That's all I got.

277
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,127
You've got a bunch of blood
being illegally transported

278
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,926
and a dead kid missing seven pints.

279
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,332
Maybe we should check to see if
there's a connection between the two.

280
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,428
When we get the DNA results back from
the samples taken at the accident,

281
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,167
let's see if we can
get a match to Steven.

282
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,236
It's worth a shot.

283
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,601
Hmm.

284
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,078
You know, I've been
at this job a while.

285
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,505
But it seems like this town
is just getting weirder.

286
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:08,876
Hmm.

287
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,449
"Geiers have an innate ability
to move through trees,

288
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,551
"staying above their victims,
who walk beneath them, unaware."

289
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,932
"Geiers are the most vile of all.

290
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,532
"They harvest human organs while
the victims are still alive,

291
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,110
"seeming to take pleasure in
the savage pain they cause.

292
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,904
"Carnage on the front
lines has provided them

293
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,712
"with a seemingly endless supply of
viscera for their terrible trade."

294
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,092
Hey. What are you doing for dinner?

295
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,852
Well, there was a heart, kidney,
liver, gall bladders...

296
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,259
A lot of blood being
transported when he got hit.

297
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,794
Driver had a fake ID.
We can't identify him.

298
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,565
The only thing I know
is he was a Geier.

299
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,763
I saw him right before he died.

300
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,142
What's my favorite color?

301
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,300
What?

302
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,940
You know, you never ask
me about anything else.

303
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,174
Like sports or music or who
the hottest Bond babe was.

304
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,276
You know, like normal conversation?

305
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:17,843
I'm just saying.

306
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,821
It would be nice to switch it
up once in awhile, you know?

307
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,159
Well... What's your favorite color?

308
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,589
You don't mean that.

309
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,925
No, really. I want to know.

310
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,260
Red.

311
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,096
Well, I feel so much
closer to you now.

312
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,366
Fine.

313
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,110
Yeah. If there are organs involved,

314
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,908
then most likely it
was a Geier deal.

315
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,073
What do you mean, "deal"?

316
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,484
Geiers are like herbalists,
you know?

317
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,212
Eastern medicine types.

318
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:53,688
You know how some humans
use exotic animal parts

319
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,722
like bear gall bladders and rhino
horns for, like, you know...

320
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,225
Medicinal remedies and
aphrodisiacs and stuff?

321
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:03,494
Which is ridiculous,
because it has no effect whatsoever.

322
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,429
Here's the thing.

323
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,665
Human parts for
creature enhancement?

324
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,608
That actually works great.

325
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,968
You're serious. Oh, yeah.

326
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,845
Our exotic animals are you.

327
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,651
What, you're telling me that
Geiers deal in human organs?

328
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,411
Well... Okay.

329
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,411
This might be a little awkward.

330
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,287
But, for example, you probably
didn't know that your testicles...

331
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,288
I mean, not your testicles,
specifically,

332
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,896
but that part of the
human male anatomy

333
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,696
has a kind of a Viagra-like
effect on certain species.

334
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,905
Not that I ever had need to...

335
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,570
I mean, everything works great.

336
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,734
Oh, no. That wasn't awkward at all.

337
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,640
Okay, so, where would
someone like you

338
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,387
get something like that?

339
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:01,716
Um...

340
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,327
There's a place that I've...
I've heard of.

341
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,966
Not that I've ever, you know,
been there. Or anything.

342
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,266
May I help you?

343
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:22,835
Uh, yeah.

344
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,040
I'm here for the, um...

345
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,546
Catch of the day.

346
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,812
Got some ID?

347
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,927
I haven't had a Blutbad
in here in a long time.

348
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,868
I haven't seen a Fuchsbau
in a Waschbar's age, myself.

349
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,935
What are you looking for? Um...

350
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,598
Maybe a little Gallenblase.

351
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,539
It's fresh, isn't it?

352
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,839
Gallenblase doesn't stay on the
shelf long enough to get old.

353
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,509
Three ounce or the six ounce?

354
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,984
Huh? Oh, it's really for a friend.
So, I don't know.

355
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,488
Um... Six ounce?

356
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,316
I'll be right out.

357
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,726
You want it gift wrapped?
No. Thanks.

358
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,202
If you're partial to mixing,

359
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,908
I find that gall bladder flavor
goes very well with the white tea.

360
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,371
Just the powder, thanks.

361
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,104
That will be $300.

362
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,508
Are you kidding me?

363
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,646
You must not have
bought some in awhile.

364
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,187
The price has been
going through the roof.

365
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,254
Thanks.

366
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,357
You're not going to say that
when you hear the price.

367
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,896
$300.

368
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,334
Are you kidding me?
That's exactly what I said.

369
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,731
How do you know you just
didn't pay $300 for oregano?

370
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:56,828
I don't know.

371
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,238
Put it in some white
tea and find out.

372
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,536
I think I'll go with the crime lab.

373
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,970
Chicken. By the way,
he's a Fuchsbau.

374
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,980
So, count your fingers
after you shake hands.

375
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,572
Right. Three hundred bucks?

376
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,008
I'll owe you.

377
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,851
You've got a connection.

378
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,626
This confirms that the DNA

379
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,527
from some of the blood in
the S.U.V. matches the kid.

380
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,395
Well, that would explain
the holes in his neck.

381
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,593
Somebody was taking his blood.
And selling it.

382
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,064
But none of the organs in the
S.U.V. match Steven or one another.

383
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,630
So, we've got a lot of blood and a lot of
human body parts from different people.

384
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,871
Somebody has been harvesting human organs,
and not from a hospital.

385
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,006
Check out this histology.

386
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:46,085
No lesions, fat, cirrhosis,
or pathology of any kind.

387
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,215
Young and healthy.
Perfect specimens. Red market.

388
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,427
They pulled Steven off the street.

389
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,689
Maybe that's where they're
getting their victims.

390
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,628
Homeless kids and runaways.
Nobody would miss them.

391
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,366
Then, we need to run a check.
See if there are any missing street kids.

392
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,534
But there may not be any
missing reports filed.

393
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,833
Let's expand our
search to out of state.

394
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,673
Yeah, Burkhardt.

395
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,370
LAB TECH: I got the report
back on the contents

396
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,969
of that bottle you
wanted identified.

397
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,208
I've got to tell you.
It's a little bizarro.

398
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,942
Pure human gall bladder.
Dried and ground.

399
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,880
Nothing more, nothing less.

400
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,682
Anything else you need to know?

401
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,519
No, that's it. Thank you.

402
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,093
You know what? I'm going to go check
the warrant on that driver's phone.

403
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,800
How are you? I am here for the...

404
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,507
Catch of the day.

405
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,606
Fuchsbau, right?

406
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,173
Oh, my God.

407
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,709
Let's talk about the Gallenblase.

408
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,011
Don't kill me.

409
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,244
Who do you get your
Gallenblase from?

410
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,513
I don't know what
you're talking about.

411
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:50,575
Yeah, you do.

412
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,150
Human gall bladder?

413
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:05,594
Don't hurt me.
I didn't do anything.

414
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,761
You're selling human organs.

415
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,429
I'm just the shop owner.
I don't kill them myself.

416
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,597
Is that supposed to
make you innocent?

417
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,602
You are going to tell
me everything you know.

418
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,432
The guys will kill me.

419
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,875
Maybe you shouldn't be in
business with them, then.

420
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,704
You can take your chances
with them or with me.

421
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,408
But right now,
I'm here and they're not.

422
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,212
I don't know their names
or where they are.

423
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,915
One of them makes a
delivery once a week.

424
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,048
How do you get in contact with him?

425
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,490
I text him when I need something.

426
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,185
Write down the number.

427
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,794
Same guy makes the
delivery every week?

428
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,197
He's the only one lever saw.

429
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,037
This the guy?

430
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,730
Yes.

431
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,932
When do you see him next?

432
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,438
I was supposed to get a new shipment
yesterday, but he never showed.

433
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,671
Well, that's because he's dead.

434
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,270
Oh, God. You killed him?

435
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:51,974
Show me the rest of your supply.

436
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,159
You no longer sell human organs.

437
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,565
Yeah, Dispatch,
this is Detective Burkhardt.

438
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:15,900
I want you to run a number for me.

439
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,565
Go ahead. I'll text it over to you.

440
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,131
And call me when you get something.

441
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,301
Okay, will do.

442
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,487
Wow, it looks like stuff I
used to wear in college.

443
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,029
Where did you get this?

444
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,491
I actually got it from a street
kid I was interviewing on a case.

445
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,426
Mmm. That means there's more to
this than just some cheap gift.

446
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,369
Uh, that actually cost me $20.

447
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,642
You softie.

448
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,736
You know, actually
I was thinking...

449
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,181
Maybe for dinner tonight,
we could, uh...

450
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,480
Uh-huh. Where are
we taking this kid?

451
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,022
It's actually two kids.
A brother and a sister.

452
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,418
Living on the streets? That's so sad.
How old are they?

453
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,289
Still in their teens.

454
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,354
Well, do you even know
where to find them?

455
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,523
I think I do.

456
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,834
Okay. Well, let's get going.
I'm hungry.

457
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,365
You're sure you're okay with this?

458
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,098
Well, I can't exactly
let you go alone.

459
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:26,073
There's no telling
what you might buy.

460
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,210
Gracie? Hanson.

461
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,252
Uh, this is Juliette.

462
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,923
Hi. I really love the necklace.

463
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,454
You made it, right?

464
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,186
What do you want? Hanson.

465
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,094
He's not here by accident.

466
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,395
I just want to figure out what
happened to your friend Steven.

467
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,171
And Juliette and I are going to go grab a
bite to eat, if you want to come along.

468
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,535
We can take care of ourselves.

469
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:57,801
Speak for yourself.

470
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,331
I'm going.

471
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,600
Yeah, I'm going.

472
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,005
Do you need any help?

473
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,649
No. I've got it.

474
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,216
Where are you guys from?

475
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,122
Idaho.

476
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,664
Oh, I've been to Idaho.
Whereabouts?

477
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,930
Near Pocatello.
Why do you want to know?

478
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,168
Sorry. Hanson doesn't
really trust police.

479
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,035
That's cool. He actually
had to win me over, too.

480
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,130
Ah. Hmm.

481
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,335
Thanks for the food.

482
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,708
I know you're probably wondering
why we're living on the streets.

483
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,138
It's pretty simple.
Our parents sucked.

484
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,705
Gracie, you don't have
to tell them anything.

485
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:40,772
No, you don't.

486
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,710
Look, I just wanna know if you know
anybody else like Steven who disappeared.

487
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,983
People come and go all the time.

488
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,082
Yeah, but did anybody get
jobs and never come back?

489
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:50,415
Yeah. Kevin.

490
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,257
He left about four
weeks ago with Steven.

491
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,895
All right. Did he say
anything before he left?

492
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,194
Anything about the job
where he was going...

493
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,504
He just said it was going to pay,
like, 10 bucks an hour.

494
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,601
Either of you offered jobs? No.

495
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:09,003
Did Kevin or Steven, uh,
mention how they found out about this job?

496
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,010
Yeah, Kevin said some
guy in a white van

497
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,674
just came up to him in the street.

498
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,739
What street?

499
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,009
I don't know.

500
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,213
You ever seen this white van?

501
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,518
Mmm-mmm.

502
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,128
What was, uh, Kevin's last name?

503
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:27,163
Standish.

504
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,363
You liked Kevin, didn't you?

505
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,232
Yeah, I did.

506
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,201
You must miss him.

507
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,069
When he left with Steven,
did he ask you to go with him?

508
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,203
Yes.

509
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,848
You never told me that.

510
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:51,010
I wasn't going to leave you.
You were sick.

511
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,347
Did Kevin say anything
at all when he left?

512
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:58,554
Yeah, he said he was going to call and
leave me a message at the shelter.

513
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,358
But he never did.

514
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,460
All right, look. If either of
you ever see this white van,

515
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,594
you think you can call me?

516
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,698
Yeah. Yeah. Got to go,
so... Thanks for the food.

517
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,535
Bye.

518
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,907
Thank you. You're welcome.

519
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,455
You know, you're
pretty good at this.

520
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,546
You should have been a cop.

521
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,717
No, it's just girl instinct.

522
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,354
I know what it's like to have a
guy disappear and not call you.

523
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,136
I feel sorry for those kids.

524
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,693
Yeah, so do I.

525
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,397
And I owe you a better date night.

526
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,807
No, you don't. That was fine.

527
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,972
Anyway, we still have
time for dessert.

528
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:56,908
What?

529
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,219
I love you.

530
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,885
Burkhardt

531
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,953
I've got an address on
that phone number you sent.

532
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,432
Yeah, what have you got?
21343 Murtaugh Road.

533
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,833
21343 Murtaugh Road?

534
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:14,996
Yeah.

535
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:18,635
All right, got it.

536
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,048
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you what Kevin said to me.

537
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,140
It's okay.

538
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:31,776
I wouldn't have left you.

539
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,650
Look. I know. I know.

540
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,889
You think he's okay?

541
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,959
Yeah. Yeah. He's okay.

542
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,678
A hundred and one.
I'd tell you to stay in bed, but...

543
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:08,721
I'm going to give you
some antibiotics.

544
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,784
And if your throat gets worse,
you need to take them.

545
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,885
You can do that, right?

546
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,487
Yes.

547
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,793
You still selling
those shell necklaces?

548
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,163
Yeah. You want another one?

549
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:23,366
Um, maybe next time.
Where's your brother?

550
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,873
Outside waiting for me.

551
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,503
And when was the last time you ate?

552
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,271
Last night.

553
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,813
What about this morning?

554
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,576
I ate a lot last night.

555
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:35,015
A detective took me out for dinner.

556
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,883
I had a steak and some fries.

557
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,444
A detective took you to dinner?

558
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:40,982
Me and my brother.

559
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,355
He's trying to find out what
happened to Steven and Kevin.

560
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,955
I know you probably don't
remember them, but...

561
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,361
Anyway, Steven is dead now. So...

562
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,726
He's trying to find out, uh,
if we know anyone else who got jobs.

563
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,066
Well, do you?

564
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:59,199
I don't know. I just said that they
got jobs from somebody in a white van

565
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,868
and I'm supposed to
call if I see it.

566
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,546
Well, I just want you
to stay out of the rain.

567
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,012
I don't want you to get pneumonia.

568
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,111
And take these twice a day with food,
if you can find some.

569
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:10,777
Thanks, Doctor.

570
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:17,622
Kevin Standish was reported missing
from Cody, Wyoming, May of last year.

571
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:21,323
Apparently, he left Portland the
same night Steven did in a white van.

572
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,059
Steven turns up dead,
and Kevin is still missing.

573
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,657
That's what it looks like.

574
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,668
If someone is operating on these kids,
where are they doing it?

575
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:29,637
We don't know. But we have
information from the driver's phone.

576
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:32,300
Well, believe it or not, there was
only one number ever dialed from it.

577
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,569
And dialed a lot.

578
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:37,135
We triangulated it down to a radius
of 1,000 feet northwest of town.

579
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,340
Pretty remote area.

580
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:42,078
Closest address hit was
21343 Murtaugh Road.

581
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:43,952
If someone is dealing
in stolen body parts,

582
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,682
there's going to be a lot of
families who want answers.

583
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,150
I'm going with you
guys on this one.

584
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,931
I don't like the
looks of this place.

585
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,473
Portland P.D.

586
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,149
We have a warrant. Open up.

587
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,643
We've got some kind of
greenhouse out here.

588
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,546
Oh.

589
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,549
What the hell?

590
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:51,679
These are human organs.
Hearts, gall bladders, kidneys.

591
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,208
This is unbelievable.

592
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:02,047
Why would you dry them out instead
of selling them for transplant?

593
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:07,287
Some cultures use animal organs to
make medicines and aphrodisiacs.

594
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,163
Bear gall bladder, rhino horn.

595
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,563
So, what, if animal liver is good,
a human one must be better?

596
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,539
Well, whichever way you look at it,
it's still cannibalism.

597
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,236
Uh, I think it's
pronounced capitalism.

598
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,433
Folter Clinic.
How may I direct your call?

599
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,636
Who is it? It's the clinic.

600
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,706
You're going to the
shelter tonight.

601
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:57,769
Not without you.

602
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,542
You're the one who's sick. Not me.

603
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,515
I'm not going there alone.

604
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:04,451
Hey. You're the girl
that sells the necklaces.

605
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:06,711
Yeah.

606
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,281
Oh. Well, I'd sure like to
buy a couple. Is it too late?

607
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,623
No. They're in my pack.
I've just got to get them out.

608
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:13,891
You're Hanson, right?

609
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:14,952
Yeah.

610
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,930
I thought I recognized
you from the clinic.

611
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,760
What are you doing?

612
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,732
Hurry up. Get them inside.

613
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,369
Go!

614
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,600
Where are we? GRACIE: Let go of me.
Where are we going?

615
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,195
Get them inside. Hanson.

616
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,671
What are you doing? Here we go.

617
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,071
Gracie.

618
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:15,090
People will find us. You're not
going to get away with this.

619
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,717
- You can't do this.
- Move it.

620
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,022
Move it.

621
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:20,585
Let go.

622
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,812
We have a warrant to
search the premises.

623
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,509
There's nobody here.
Everybody has gone home.

624
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:42,983
Open it up or we'll break it down.

625
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,233
They're not operating
on anybody here.

626
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,601
There's got to be another place.

627
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,197
Let me talk to her.

628
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,509
Look at me. Very closely.

629
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,740
I know what you are.

630
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,078
I don't know what you're...
You're a Geier.

631
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,413
Oh, my God. Where are the kids?

632
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,475
I...

633
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,682
I'm not asking you as a cop,
so don't expect me to behave like one.

634
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,287
FEMALE ASSISTANT: Got it.

635
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:30,956
We got them.

636
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,226
Where are they?

637
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,965
Getting prepped. I didn't
think you'd want to wait.

638
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,973
I don't. We'll do them next.

639
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,233
Let's start with the girl first.

640
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,380
We finish up tonight's work,
and that's it.

641
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,786
I can have the trucks
here by the morning.

642
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,324
And what about the
records at the clinic?

643
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,190
Everything that matters has been
destroyed. We're good to go.

644
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,286
Gracie. Please.

645
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,189
No.

646
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:11,525
I'll take care of this.

647
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,672
No. Please.

648
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,971
So much for the surprise!

649
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,073
Police!

650
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,992
I got this. Get her.

651
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,370
Gracie?

652
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,267
Gracie, can you hear me?

653
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,715
Hey. Everything's okay.

654
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,079
It's all going to be okay now.

655
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,609
Where's Hanson?

656
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,177
Hanson's fine.

657
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,184
I saw Kevin. He's here.

658
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,247
We have Kevin.

659
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,359
How did you find us?

660
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,218
This town is definitely
getting weirder.

661
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,846
Hello.

662
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:58,154
Did you get your present?

663
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,961
Where should I send
the thank-you note?

664
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,726
You made your point.
Now, we are making ours.

665
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,825
The world is becoming
more complicated.

666
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,529
Only for the simple minded.

667
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:12,301
You are going to have to control
this Grimm or get rid of him.

668
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,809
What I do and how I do it
are none of your concern.

669
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,846
I speak for the Verrat,
and they have a different opinion.

670
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,405
Things are getting out of balance.

671
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:24,442
A Grimm on his own is like
a samurai without a master.

672
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:27,011
Well, this one has a
badge and a conscience.

673
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:28,886
That is your problem.

674
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,651
You know, next time, you might want
to deliver your message in person.

675
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,323
Next time we will.
