            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2010 by a small group of enthusiasts, TechCon has grown from a one-day regional meetup to a multi-day international conference. Over the years we expanded our program to include hands-on workshops, startup showcases, and deep-dive technical tutorials.</p>
